This package provide methods for controlling GPIO pins, I2C and SPI buses.
This is written for A20-OLinuXino-MICRO, but it can be used with other boards. If you do
this we cannot guarantee proper operation of the module. Before using this
package we recommend reading the article at olimex [wiki](https://www.olimex.com/wiki/A20-OLinuXino-MICRO)

When using GPIO make sure that the desired gpio is not used by another periphery.
